Contribution:
    • The base idea was designed by detailed discussion among all the group members.
            ▪ Key points which were the part of discussion are as follows:-
                    ◦ How to implement PID.
                    ◦ What parameters should be taken as error for PID controlloer.
                    ◦ What should be the assumptions to make in order to design.
                    ◦  How to give corrrect direction.
                    ◦ Understanding PID controller and lokking to it’s some of it’s implementation.

We discussed together and came up with logic about following functionallity:-
How to implement parking?
How to detect node?
How to switch to black line follower


    • The coding was done by all of us separately(but with discussion) as we all were implementing similiar ideas. 

PID tuning Contribution :-
    • All of the group members contributed equally in PID tuning.
    • We all sat together to run several itterations to check sensor threshold and to adjust our kp and ki value.
